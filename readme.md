# Datahub Semantic CSS

This is an adoptation of the same work that used to be in the datahub repository. 
Its currently rough around the edges and needs some work that i will detail in a backlog issue before this can be published to npm.

The idea is that we mantain a minimal viable custom build of semantic css for all datahub related or themed projects.

An old build of this setup is already used in the datahub project.
